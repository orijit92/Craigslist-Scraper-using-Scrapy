However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.     Many customers actually take delivery While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.      We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.     This is another very common situation that usually prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.     We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.  We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.

It is a missing lug on the front left and the tires could be better and then Clean it!!    The drivers window needs the regulator installed and the new part in ready to be installed.   For those that don't know that means some time working on the install for that window assembly .  The new part comes with the deal.  It Didn't have a muffler when I bought it and still doesn't  however it's  not loud at all.  It        ""needed""     brakes on the front end to avoid disaster :-)   That work is done?!!  They have maybe 500 miles on them with absolutely no problem.  Stereo works but the speaker that's in the driver side door isn't a fit. AC was overhauled mid summer for a boat trip to the Gorge for a 3 day run and it towed fabulously.  The toe was for a 22 foot runabout ski boat heavily loaded for fun and it went perfect coming and going from Snoqualmie to Quincy and back and the trailer lights functioned perfectly.  This is in Snoqualmie and the location for the paperwork is in the Safeway parking lot in North bend the ladies are fabulous at expediting and helping!  If I find any time I'll keep cleaning and the like but that's not likely."
